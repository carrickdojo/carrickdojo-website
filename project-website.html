                <p>
                  This is a very big project to rebuild the CarrickDojo website.

                  With our website's 10 year birthday coming this year. We are
                  looking to move away from Wordpress for our website, and
                  create a new site based on the Raspberry Pi Web Design
                  Projects that can be administered by the Ninjas directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a wealth of amazing resources from CoderDojo and the
                  Raspberry Pi projects pages on web design. We hope to create a
                  site that builds on them, and provides some additional
                  information on how and why we host our site.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The code behind the websites we view was generated by a
                  computer. By writing the CarrickDojo.com in clean HTML and
                  CSS, Ninja's can inspect the pages and follow the code.

                  At the moment this is just a big overview of our website,
                  however making a step-by-step guide to our website is a goal!

                <p>
                  Our website is for sharing information with anyone who wants
                  to know more about what we are and what we do.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before we jump into creating a web site, we need to know a
                  little bit about what web sites are, why they were created
                  like they are and how can people make their own webs pages.
                </p>

                  alt=""
                  class="image-medium shadow-small" />
                <h3>Why did we need webpages?</h3>
                <p>
                  In the late 1980's lots of people where sharing their work
                  with each other by sending text files over the Internet. They
                  wanted a way to share files that could link (hyperlinks) to
                  other peoples files.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>
                    The World Wide Web was developed at CERN (The European
                    Organization for Nuclear Research) by Tim Berners-Lee and
                    his team between 1989-1991. In
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">
                      the proposal</a
                    >, Tim lays out the need and the benefits of linked
                    information systems and hypertext. His idea of "a web of
                    notes with links (like references) between them".</span

                <h3>How do webpages work?</h3>

                <p>There are four keys parts to the world wide web.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>The browser</b> - this is software for our computers for
                    viewing webpages. For me this is Firefox (Brave, Chrome,
                    Edge, Safari and Opera and all browsers)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>The web pages</b> - these are the HTML (Hypertext Markup
                    Language) files we create for our websites containing the
                    information we want to share (you are currently visiting the
                    HTML page called project-website.html)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>The server</b> - the server is where we put our webpages
                    (this website is using a Vercel server with more detail in
                    the hosting section)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>The web protocol</b> - a protocol is a set of rules to
                    follow. The HyperText Transfer Protocol is a set of rules
                    used by browsers and web servers to communicate and transfer
                    the HTML pages over the Internet (this website uses HTTPS a
                    secure HTTP connection)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  <span>
                    The World Wide Web was originally created for use within
                    CERN, however they realised other people would pay to use
                    it. CERN licenced the World Wide Web for the first few years
                    competing with other linked information systems. In April
                    1993,
                    <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399/">
                      CERN released the World Wide Web</a
                    >
                    into the public domain. Thousands of websites popped up
                    within a year.</span

                  <li>The first ever website went live in August, 1991</li>
                  <li>
                    The milestone of 1 billion websites was reached in September
                    2014
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There were around 1.2 billion websites at the end of 2023
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There were around 200 million active websites at the end of
                    2023 (about 4/5 of websites are inactive)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Approximately 150,000 new websites are created everyday
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The Web is an essential part of the modern world and everyday,
                  the majority of people in the world use it. When developing
                  websites, learning the history helps us to understand why
                  things are as they are. The original idea of the web never
                  considered using images (and definitely not video); over the
                  last three decades, countless people have extended the Web
                  beyond anything that was originally considered.
                </p>

                <h2 id="creating-html">Creating HTML Files</h2>
                <p>
                  HTML is a simple, plain text file written in a particular way
                  (syntax) that has a file extension (the last bit of the file
                  name after the last dot) of HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                  HTML is a very forgiving. This means, if you make a mistake
                  with the HTML syntax, the browser will still try and display
                  the content. This makes it easier for people new to computers
                  to get started.
                </p>
                <div class="note text-emphasis-big">
                  When HTML was released, a lot of computer scientists at the
                  time thought it was very bad the code would continue to run if
                  a bug was found and that only an error message should be
                  displayed.
                </div>

                  Every computer can create plain text files, and we can create
                  web pages in any text editor; however there are tools that
                  make web development easier and more accurate.

                <p>
                  There are multiple tools for creating HTML pages online. Many
                  of the older Raspberry Pi Web Design projects used Trinket;
                  however a newer tool has recently been launched. This is a
                  great tool for getting started and is used in newer projects.

                  A code editor is a piece of software used by a programmers for
                  writing code. They generally contain lots of different tools
                  and features for checking for code mistakes and making writing
                  code faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For working on websites, my preference is Visual Studio Code,
                  a free, open source, and cross-platform code editor created by
                  Microsoft.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Anyone can write an extension (extra code and functionality)
                  for Visual Studio Code and there are lots of really useful
                  tools written by other programmers.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Live Server - this allows us to quickly create a webserver
                    on our computer so we can test our code.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Github Integration - we can share our code with the rest of
                    our team easily (full details in the Git section)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Prettier - makes our code look nice with different colours
                    for elements and tags.

                <p>
                  Just like HTML, CSS is a simple, plain text file written in a
                  particular way (syntax) that has a file extension (the last
                  bit of the file name after the last dot) of CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All our content goes in the HTML page and we use HTML tags to
                  layout it out on our page. For example, this paragraph is
                  written within our HTML file.
                </p>
                <p>CSS is used apply style to the content in our HTML files.</p>

                  When we make a website, we need to think about how our content

                </p>
                <p>
                  For our site, we need to make sure our site looks good for
                  people on small screens (like mobile phones) and for people
                  with big screens (laptops and desktop computer monitors).

                  For our site, we are going to use two separate CSS files
                  depending on if the user is on a big screen or a small screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our default.css file; we tell the browser to load a large
                  screen css file if the minimum width is 768 pixels; or a small
                  screen css file if the maximum width the browser has is 480
                  pixels.

                  These files will have the navigation and footer elements that
                  are specific to big screens and little screens.

                  On a big screen we want the user to have buttons for all our

                  is not enough space for this.

                  <span>
                    On small screen, we have a <b>hamburger button</b>, and when
                    this is clicked, they will see the links to our pages.

                <p>
                  The footer can be spread out on a big screen, but on a small
                  screen we want the links in a column.

                  Github is the largest and most used. It was bought by
                  Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5 Billion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have decided to use Github for hosting our Git repository.

                    Github Accounts! Github state in their terms of use that

                    Github is a site that was designed to share code and a great
                    place to showcase projects you are proud of.

                    <br />
                    Be very careful of what you share and comment as Github is
                    very a closely tracked site.

                <p>
                  When sharing code, one of the questions will be on the type of
                  licence. Software licensing is very complex and always
                  changing because every country have their own rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As our Website is something that might help other Ninjas,
                  Dojos or people making websites; we are going to share the
                  code with everyone and allow anyone to use and make changes to
                  suit them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are going to use the Creative Commons license for the
                  project. This means everyone can share, copy and use are code;
                  but no one should start charging money if they do copy some of
                  it.

                  Every website needs a server for hosting and there are lots of
                  things to consider with web hosting.

                    <span>
                      Websites often serve <b>dynamic</b> content, this means
                      they are two-way, where the user sends information to the
                      web server and gets specific content back (think using a
                      search engine).
                      <br />
                      Our site is HTML and CSS and considered <b> static</b>;
                      this makes it remarkably easy to host.</span

                  Website Hosting Considerations
                </h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Traffic - we are probably not going to have a huge amount of
                    people visiting our site at once.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Security - we need to make sure the connection of our
                    webserver is secure, this means we need to use https and not
                    just http.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Administration - this means looking after the hosting for as
                    long as it is up. As we are all volunteers, we need to make
                    sure our hosting is well documented and has instructions
                    that anyone can follow.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Costs - there are lots of free options for hosting static
                    websites, additionally as a not-for-profit organisation,
                    many of the large technology companies are happy to provide
                    us free resources.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Location - we want to make sure our website is hosted in the
                    European Union as there are lots of rules about moving data
                    outside of the EU. Luckily, Ireland hosts all the major
                    cloud companies and has lots of little service providers.

                </ul>

                <p>
                  For the development of the site, we have decided to use
                  Vercel. Vercel are the developers of Next.Js and provide a
                  very good free tier offering that does not require a credit
                  card.
                </p>

                /></a>

                <ul>
                  <u> Key reasons for going with Vercel:</u>
                  <li>
                    The free tier hobby account should meet our traffic needs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Integration with Github - when we update our Website Git
                    Repo, Vercel will see the changes, and deploy a new version
                    of our site.
                  </li>
                  <li>Following Domain Verification, HTTPS is automatic.</li>

                <h2 id="#our-domain-name">Our Domain Name</h2>
                <p>
                  Our domain name is carrickdojo.com; our first Dojo Champion
                  registered the domain on Friday 21st of November 2014.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Domain names provide us a way to create helpful names for
                  Internet resources so we can easily remember them.
                </p>
                <div class="factoid">
                  Domain names are older than webpages and one of the key parts
                  of the Internet.
                </div>

                <p>
                  It is a lot easier for me to tell people our website is at
                  www.carrickdojo.com and not 76.76.21.9.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To understand this more, we need to learn a little bit about
                  the Domain Naming System (normally just called DNS).

                <p>
                  When computers talk to each other over the Internet, they all
                  use the Internet Protocol (IP) a set of rules everyone agreed
                  to.
