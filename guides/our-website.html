              The CarrickDojo Website
            </h1>

            <h2 class="">Background</h2>

            <p>
              With our website's 10 year birthday coming this year, we decided
              to move away from WordPress for our website, and create a new site
              in HTML and CSS based on the Raspberry Pi Web Design Projects that
              can be administered by the Ninjas directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a wealth of amazing resources from CoderDojo and the
              Raspberry Pi projects pages on web design. Our site has been built
              using parts from lots of different projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              By writing the carrickdojo.com in HTML and CSS, Ninja's can
              inspect the pages and follow the code. We welcome everyone to make
              changes and add content to our site and help improve it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="">Website Goals</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Have a website so people can learn about our Dojo, what we do
                and how to join or help out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Write the website code in HTML and CSS to better align with the
                Raspberry Pi Web Design projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure best practices with a child-first led approach to data
                and content that is understandable by everyone.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make the website accessible ensuring visitors can navigate our
                website and access our content with screen readers and other
                technologies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design the website with a similar style to the CoderDojo
                foundation website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Document our website from first-principles with the aim of
                Ninja's being able to get further involved.
              </li>
            </ul>

              A Little Bit of Web History
            </h1>

            <h2 id="the-web">The World Wide Web</h2>
            <p>
              Our website is for sharing information with anyone who wants to
              know more about what we are and what we do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we jump into our web site, we need to know a little bit
              about what web sites are, why they were created like they are and
              how can people make their own webs pages.
            </p>

            <h3>Why did we need webpages?</h3>
            <p>
              In the late 1980's lots of people where sharing their work with
              each other by sending text files over the Internet. They wanted a
              way to share files that could link (hyperlinks) to other peoples
              files.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                The World Wide Web was developed at CERN (The European
                Organization for Nuclear Research) by Tim Berners-Lee and his
                team between 1989-1991. In
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">
                  the proposal</a
                >, Tim lays out the need and the benefits of linked information
                systems and hypertext. His idea of "a web of notes with links
                (like references) between them".</span
              >
            </p>

            <h3>How do webpages work?</h3>

            <p>There are four keys parts to the world wide web.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>The browser</b> - this is software for our computers for
                viewing webpages. For me this is Firefox (Brave, Chrome, Edge,
                Safari and Opera and all browsers)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>The web pages</b> - these are the HTML (Hypertext Markup
                Language) files we create for our websites containing the
                information we want to share (you are currently visiting the
                HTML page called project-website.html)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>The server</b> - the server is where we put our webpages
                (this website is using a Vercel server with more detail in the
                hosting section)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>The web protocol</b> - a protocol is a set of rules to
                follow. The HyperText Transfer Protocol is a set of rules used
                by browsers and web servers to communicate and transfer the HTML
                pages over the Internet (this website uses HTTPS a secure HTTP
                connection)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <span>
                The World Wide Web was originally created for use within CERN,
                however they realised other people would pay to use it. CERN
                licenced the World Wide Web for the first few years competing
                with other linked information systems. In April 1993,
                <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399/">
                  CERN released the World Wide Web</a
                >
                into the public domain. Thousands of websites popped up within a
                year.</span
              >
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first ever website went live in August, 1991</li>
              <li>
                The milestone of 1 billion websites was reached in September
                2014
              </li>
              <li>There were around 1.2 billion websites at the end of 2023</li>
              <li>
                There were around 200 million active websites at the end of 2023
                (about 4/5 of websites are inactive)
              </li>
              <li>Approximately 150,000 new websites are created everyday</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Web is an essential part of the modern world and everyday, the
              majority of people in the world use it. When developing websites,
              learning the history helps us to understand why things are as they
              are. The original idea of the web never considered using images
              (and definitely not video); over the last three decades, countless
              people have extended the Web beyond anything that was originally
              considered.

              Our Website Layout
            </h1>

            <h2 class="project-section-title">Our Home Page</h2>
            <p>
              When you go to
              <a href="carrickdojo.com" class="text-leitrim">carrickdojo.com</a>
              , your web browser will automatically look for a page called
              <b>index.html</b> and if it exists it will display it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no rule to say browsers should do this, but it became a
              convention (a way of doing things) because it made sense and so
              all browsers choose to do this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our index.html is also called our homepage and is our most
              important page as it will be viewed by most of our visitors.
            </p>

            <h2 class="project-section-title">Site Map</h2>
            <p>
              We can create any page we want for carrickdojo.com. You are
              currently reading the page our-website.html in our guides folder.
              A website is a collection of different pages and folders of pages
              that we host on a web server.
            </p>
            <p>
              As some websites can grow to be hundreds or thousands of pages, it
              is good to have a map. We call the website map a sitemap and it
              just lists all the pages we have and the folders they are in.
            </p>
            <p>
              A sitemap can be very useful for people working together on a
              website, but it is especially useful for bots. Bots are automated
              software programs that crawl the Internet for new pages and
              content. Some bots are useful and needed to create search engines
              and map the Internet; and some are bad, looking to steal sensitive
              user information or other malicious activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no rules on the layout and folder structure of website
              and there are lots of different approaches.

            <p>
              All our main HTML pages sit in the root folder along with folders
              for css, fonts, images and guides. The root folder is the name
              given to the first or top-most directory in a hierarchy. It can be
              likened to the trunk of a tree, as the starting point where all
              branches originate from it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="">Page Layout</h2>
            <p>
              HTML is all about layout and how content gets displayed on a page.
              Most modern web development frameworks help programmers write less
              code and a core principle of coding is DRY (Do Not Repeat
              Yourself).
            </p>
            <p>
              We are not using any frameworks and have no simple way to create
              reusable components without increasing our website complexity.
              This means we need to write the header, navigation bar and footer
              for each page.
            </p>

            <h3>Page Components</h3>
            <p>
              Page components or page elements are the main building blocks of
              our website. They consist of our header, navigation, main section,
              (possible a side section) and a footer.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                At the top of each page is the <b>header</b>. We are using this
                currently to alert people the site is under development.
              </li>
              <li>
                Below the <b>header</b> comes our <b>navigation bar</b>. This
                component uses a small bit of Java Script to handle the mobile
                screen menu.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are two types of main section that we use. Our standard
                <b>main</b> displays just a single column (like our homepage).
                We use a <b>main with aside</b> to create pages with a left hand
                navigation section (just like this page).
              </li>
              <li>
                Our footer sits at the bottom of the page and is the same across
                all pages. It contains are key links and information on getting
                in touch.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              While HTML is all about the layout of our content, CSS is about
              how it looks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each page loads the main.css file from our css folder and uses it
              for styling the content. If this file is not loaded, our site will
              look very messy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our main.css file calls other css files for handling different
              areas of our styling. We have a css files called colours.css that
              we use to store all our colours and colour schemes together.
              Likewise, we have a fonts.css file to keep all our font css
              together.
            </p>
            <div class="box-advanced colours-grey-white">
              Having lots of little css files can be a bad thing for the
              performance of our site as the main.css needs to load before it,
              goes looking for the extra css files. We have separated the css in
              order to make it easier to manage and for new people to understand
              as opposed to one giant css file.

              <p>
                Git is a system designed to help people collaborate (work
                together) on shared files and code.
              </p>
              <p>
                Git is a version control system. This means if someone changes a
                file it records the differences between the new version and the
                old version, and maintains a history.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>
                  A Git Repository (a repo) is folder or collection of files
                  that are being tracked with Git. All the files HTML, CSS and
                  image files for this website are in our

            <p>
              Git works across platforms and can be used on Windows, Mac OS and
              Linux however each has slightly different methods of installing.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Git installed, you can open a terminal (command prompt) and
              use the command
              <span class=""
                >git clone
                https://github.com/carrickdojo/carrickdojo-website.git</span

            <h2 id="our-hosting">Our Website Hosting</h2>
            <p>
              For the development of the site, we have decided to use Vercel.
              Vercel are the developers of Next.Js and provide a very good free
              tier offering that does not require a credit card.
            </p>

                alt="vercel logo"
            /></a>

            <p>Key reasons for going with Vercel:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The free tier hobby account should meet our traffic needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integration with Github - when we update our Website Git Repo,
                Vercel will see the changes, and deploy a new version of our
                site.
              </li>
              <li>Following Domain Verification, HTTPS is automatic.</li>

            <h2 id="our-hosting">Website Hosting Access</h2>
            <p>
              Our website hosting is authenticated through email and can be
              accessed by anyone with access to the
              <a mailto="webmaster@carrickdojo.com"
                >webmaster@carrickdojo.com</a
              >
              emails.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hosting is currently pulling the main (only branch) of our
              website software repository from Github. We may update this at a
              later point, but for the time being the main branch is
              automatically deployed when updated.
            </p>
            <p class="colours-secondary pad-all text-center">
              It should not be necessary to make changes to the hosting, however
              ensuring access before committing code to the software repository
              will allow for an <b>instant rollback</b> if necessary.

            <p>
              Our domain name is carrickdojo.com; our first Dojo Champion
              registered the domain on Friday 21st of November 2014.
            </p>

            <p>
              Domain names provide us a way to create helpful names for Internet
              resources so we can easily remember them.

            <div class="box-info colours-blue-white">
              Domain names are older than webpages and one of the key parts of
              the Internet.
            </div>

            <p>
              To understand this more, we need to learn a little bit about the
              Domain Naming System (normally just called DNS).

              <p>
                When computers talk to each other over the Internet, they all
                use the Internet Protocol (IP) a set of rules everyone agreed
                to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each computer has an IP address that is unique to that computer
                just like a telephone has a unique telephone number.
              </p>
              <p>
                DNS allows us to assign real names to a computer resources so we
                don't need to remember all the different IP addresses of the
                different servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our webserver has an IP address of 76.76.21.9. It is a lot
                easier for me to tell people our website is at
                www.carrickdojo.com and not 76.76.21.9.
              </p>
              <p>
                DNS can be looked at like a phone book for all the different
                computer IP addresses.

                web hosting provider.

                The third record is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that tells
                users trying to access www.carrickdojo.com to use the same
                record as carrickdojo.com. This prevents users getting a page
                not found, if they go to www.carrickdojo.com they are redirected

              Our website is for sharing information with anyone who wants to
              know more about what we are and what we do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we jump into creating a web site, we need to know a little
              bit about what web sites are, why they were created like they are
              and how can people make their own webs pages.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Why did we need webpages?</h3>
            <p>
              In the late 1980's lots of people where sharing their work with
              each other by sending text files over the Internet. They wanted a
              way to share files that could link (hyperlinks) to other peoples
              files.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>
                The World Wide Web was developed at CERN (The European
                Organization for Nuclear Research) by Tim Berners-Lee and his
                team between 1989-1991. In
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">
                  the proposal</a
                >, Tim lays out the need and the benefits of linked information
                systems and hypertext. His idea of "a web of notes with links
                (like references) between them".</span

              <li>
                <b>The browser</b> - this is software for our computers for
                viewing webpages. For me this is Firefox (Brave, Chrome, Edge,
                Safari and Opera and all browsers)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>The web pages</b> - these are the HTML (Hypertext Markup
                Language) files we create for our websites containing the
                information we want to share (you are currently visiting the
                HTML page called project-website.html)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>The server</b> - the server is where we put our webpages
                (this website is using a Vercel server with more detail in the
                hosting section)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>The web protocol</b> - a protocol is a set of rules to

                The World Wide Web was originally created for use within CERN,
                however they realised other people would pay to use it. CERN
                licenced the World Wide Web for the first few years competing
                with other linked information systems. In April 1993,
                <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399/">

                The milestone of 1 billion websites was reached in September
                2014

              <li>There were around 1.2 billion websites at the end of 2023</li>

              The Web is an essential part of the modern world and everyday, the
              majority of people in the world use it. When developing websites,
              learning the history helps us to understand why things are as they
              are. The original idea of the web never considered using images
              (and definitely not video); over the last three decades, countless
              people have extended the Web beyond anything that was originally
              considered.

            <h2 id="creating-html">Creating HTML Files</h2>
            <p>
              HTML is a simple, plain text file written in a particular way
              (syntax) that has a file extension (the last bit of the file name
              after the last dot) of HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              HTML is a very forgiving. This means, if you make a mistake with
              the HTML syntax, the browser will still try and display the
              content. This makes it easier for people new to computers to get
              started.
            </p>
            <div class="note text-emphasis-big">
              When HTML was released, a lot of computer scientists at the time
              thought it was very bad the code would continue to run if a bug
              was found and that only an error message should be displayed.
            </div>
            <p>
              Every computer can create plain text files, and we can create web
              pages in any text editor; however there are tools that make web
              development easier and more accurate.
            </p>
            <h2 id="code-editors">Code Editors</h2>
            <p>
              There are multiple tools for creating HTML pages online. Many of
              the older Raspberry Pi Web Design projects used Trinket; however a
              newer tool has recently been launched. This is a great tool for
              getting started and is used in newer projects.

              A code editor is a piece of software used by a programmers for
              writing code. They generally contain lots of different tools and
              features for checking for code mistakes and making writing code
              faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              For working on websites, my preference is Visual Studio Code, a
              free, open source, and cross-platform code editor created by
              Microsoft.
            </p>

            />

            <p>
              Anyone can write an extension (extra code and functionality) for
              Visual Studio Code and there are lots of really useful tools
              written by other programmers.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Live Server - this allows us to quickly create a webserver on
                our computer so we can test our code.
              </li>
              <li>
                Github Integration - we can share our code with the rest of our
                team easily (full details in the Git section)
              </li>
              <li>
                Prettier - makes our code look nice with different colours for
                elements and tags.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="creating-css">Creating CSS Files</h2>
            <p>
              Just like HTML, CSS is a simple, plain text file written in a
              particular way (syntax) that has a file extension (the last bit of
              the file name after the last dot) of CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              All our content goes in the HTML page and we use HTML tags to
              layout it out on our page. For example, this paragraph is written
              within our HTML file.
            </p>
            <p>CSS is used apply style to the content in our HTML files.</p>
