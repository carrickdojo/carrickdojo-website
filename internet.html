                Sadly there are some people on the Internet that will say and
                share hurtful things, use bad language and lie. If this happens,
                never ever respond to them and ask a mentor or adult for advice

                <b>Cyberbullying</b>
                is when people are nasty to other people online. We hope none of
                our Ninjas ever bully anyone and consider it a very serious
                breaking of our rules and code of conduct.

                control their personal information and prevent unauthorized
                intrusion into their private lives. This means, people have the

                considered and thought about for a long time before governments
                make big changes to how we use technology. It can take many
                years after a problem is found before laws are created to try
                and fix it.

                GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) was designed to

                with rights on processing and retention (how long companies can

              <p>
                There are many different ways that information is shared for
                example television, radio broadcasts, articles in newspapers,
                advertisements, games, comic books, memes and many more. These
                methods of communication are known as media.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we read an article in a newspaper like the Letirim
                Oberserver or watch the RT√â News, we know the information will
                be written by a journalist or reporter that has learn how to
                present their stories with facts and evidence to support them
                and will be reviewed by an editor to ensure there are no
                mistakes or incorrect information.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the great parts of the Internet is that anyone can create
                a webpage and start writing stories, or create a Youtube channel
                or TikTok videos on any subject they like. This also creates a
                big challenge about what and who we should trust online. It can
                be difficult to judge how accurate or reliable information is;
                and we should always Stop, Think and Check when we see new
                information online or before we send on media to someone else.
