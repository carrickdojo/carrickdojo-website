              <h2>Where?</h2>
              <p>
                Our Dojo is very lucky to be supported by Leitrim County Council
                and the Hive; and to have the use of their fantastic facilities
                for our meet-ups.
              </p>
              <p class="font-emphasis">
                The Hive is a public space in Carrick-on-Shannon and Leitrim's
                Technology Enterprise Centre. We have access to super high speed
                internet access, overhead projectors and great spaces for teams
                to work together.
              </p>
              <h2>When?</h2>
              <p>
                Are meet-ups take place on Tuesday evenings at seven o'clock
                with the exception of school holiday dates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our members are told about the events ahead of schedule and
                require tickets to attend.

              <h2>How Much?</h2>
              <p>
                There are no costs to our members. CoderDojo is completely free
                and volunteer supported.
              </p>
              <p>CoderDojo is committed to sharing knowledge for free.</p>
              <h2>Do I need to bring anything?</h2>
              <p>
                If possible, every Ninja should bring a laptop with them. We do
                have a few dojo laptops that we share with people who do not
                have one.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your Ninja will not have a laptop, please let us know in
                advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ninjas under the age of 13 need to have a parent remain in the
                venue. We have a nice area in the Hive for parents to wait.

              <h2>Computers</h2>
              <p>
                If possible, every Ninja should bring a laptop with them. We do
                have a few dojo laptops that we share with people who do not
                have one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of our Ninja's use tablet computers, however they are a lot
                more prone to issues logging in to Scratch or the Raspberry Pi
                Projects and Editor.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are thinking of buying a laptop, it is worth considering
                a refurbished laptop. Their are companies that refurbish laptops
                and often these will have higher specs than many entry level
                laptops. Buying refurbished is also good for the environment.
              </p>

                has a 'Refurbished Laptop Section' that could provide a starting
                point.

              <p>
                Memory is probably the critical factor for entry level laptops
                and, in 2024 the recommended minimum RAM is 8GB . We are more
                than happy to chat about these things at our meet-ups.

              <p>
                We do not require Ninja's to have online accounts, however we
                recommend the following accounts for Ninja's in order for them
                to save their work.

              <ul>

                  Raspberry Pi / CoderDojo account - allows tracking project
                  progress and saving projects in the Code Editor. This is a UK
                  site operated by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
                </li>
                <li>

              <p>
                We need to maintain the right balance of mentors to Ninja's to
                ensure the safeguarding of our members.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mentors are all volunteers and once we know their availability

                The CoderDojo Foundation are rolling out a new ticketing system

              </p>
              <p>
                For each meetup, we will create an event on the new platform and
                parents with an account can book tickets.

                Ninjas are the young people that attend the dojo. If you're aged

              </p>
              <p>
                At a Dojo you can do a bunch of cool stuff! As well as coding,
                you could be designing video games or websites, creating awesome
                graphics, building electronic circuits or high-tech clothing, or
                even making and editing films and music! Basically, anything
                related to computers in any way!
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, you‚Äôll be working with other Dojo attendees, presenting
                the cool stuff you make to your Dojo or a showcase events, and
                once you know what you‚Äôre doing, you can start mentoring other
                attendees!

                A 'dojo' is somewhere that martial artists train, but really
                it's any place for any kind of immersive learning - somewhere to
                train a skill with others, and support each other and get better
                as a team.

                Ninjas need to focus, work hard, and never give up if things get
                tough. This is how you become a master.

                What is coding?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Code is the language of computers, including those in phones,
                cars, and even in lightbulbs! Learning to code is learning to
                talk to computers in their native language.
