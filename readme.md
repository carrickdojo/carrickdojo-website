# Carrick-on-Shannon CoderDojo Club Website

## About this Site

This is the code of the CarrickDojo Website.

We have written our site (as much as possible) in HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript.

This site aims to build off the [HTML and CSS CoderDojo Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo) and the [Raspberry Pi Web Design Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/html_and_css).

> [!NOTE]
> A key goal is to provide a functional site **without any frameworks** or transpiling that anyone can inspect the page and easily understand the underlying code.

A key factor in migrating from Wordpress to a HTML and CSS site was the moving of our Dojo ticketing to the new CoderDojo Foundation ticketing platform. As the platform matures, we will add additional functionality to hopefully allow a more seamless experience.

Additionally, we had created an AWS Lambda function to manage the 'get in touch' functionality, however are currently exploring options to reduce complexity and are currently using an iFrame to an MS Form.

> [!WARNING]
> This site breaks some rules and principles of good programming for the sake of simplicity. The plan is to fully document this project and provide context on DRY and SOLID programming and why we use frameworks and tools for developing websites.
