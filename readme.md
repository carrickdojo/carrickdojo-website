# Carrick-on-Shannon CoderDojo Club Website

## About this Site

This project is to create a new website for our CoderDojo that is written (as much as possible) in HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript while trying to maintain as much functionality as possible from our current WordPress site.

This site aims to build off the [HTML and CSS CoderDojo Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/coderdojo) and the [Raspberry Pi Web Design Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/html_and_css).

> [!NOTE]
> A key goal is to provide a functional site **without any frameworks** or transpiling that anyone can inspect the page and easily understand the underlying code.

> [!WARNING]
> This site breaks some rules and principles of good programming for the sake of simplicity. The plan is to fully document this project and provide context on DRY and SOLID programming and why we use frameworks and tools for developing websites.
